# Quick Start Guide - PDF Batch Processing

## 🚀 Ready to Process Your PDFs!

You now have a complete batch processing solution. Here's how to get started immediately:

## 📋 What You Have

✅ **Working Tools:**
- `batch_pdf_processor.py` - Command-line batch processor
- `batch_processor_gui.py` - GUI batch processor (currently running)
- `alternative_pdf_extractor_no_java.py` - Single file processor
- `streamlit_alternative_extractor.py` - Web interface

✅ **Tested & Working:**
- 10 tables extracted from your test PDF
- 34,764 characters of text extracted
- 10.37 seconds processing time
- No Java required

## 🎯 Immediate Next Steps

### Option 1: GUI Batch Processor (Recommended)
The GUI is already running! Use it to:
1. **Select Input Folder** - Choose folder with your PDFs
2. **Select Output Folder** - Choose where to save results
3. **Set Workers** - Use 4 for most systems
4. **Enable Test Mode** - Process first 3 files to test
5. **Click "Start Processing"**

### Option 2: Command Line
```bash
# Test with first 3 PDFs
python batch_pdf_processor.py "C:\path\to\your\pdfs" "C:\path\to\output" --test

# Full batch processing
python batch_pdf_processor.py "C:\path\to\your\pdfs" "C:\path\to\output" --workers 4
```

### Option 3: Web Interface
```bash
.\venv\Scripts\streamlit.exe run streamlit_alternative_extractor.py
```

## 📊 Expected Results

For each PDF, you'll get:
- **CSV files** for each table found
- **Text file** with all extracted text
- **Summary JSON** with statistics
- **Processing time** and table counts

## 🔧 Tips for Best Results

1. **Start with Test Mode** - Always test with 3 files first
2. **Organize PDFs** - Put similar documents in folders
3. **Monitor Progress** - Watch the logs for any issues
4. **Check Output** - Verify tables are extracted correctly

## 📁 Output Structure
```
output_folder/
├── batch_summary.json          # Overall results
├── batch_summary.csv           # CSV summary
├── document1/
│   ├── camelot_table_1.csv
│   ├── camelot_table_2.csv
│   ├── extracted_text.txt
│   └── summary.json
├── document2/
│   ├── camelot_table_1.csv
│   ├── extracted_text.txt
│   └── summary.json

```

## ⚡ Performance Expectations

- **Small PDFs** (< 10 pages): 5-15 seconds each
- **Medium PDFs** (10-50 pages): 15-60 seconds each
- **Large PDFs** (> 50 pages): 1-3 minutes each
- **Batch Processing**: 4 workers = ~4x faster
